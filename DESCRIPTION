Description: Estimates and provides inference for quantities that assess high dimensional mediation and potential surrogate markers including the direct effect of treatment, indirect effect of treatment, and the proportion of treatment effect explained by a surrogate/mediator; details are described in Zhou et al (2022) <doi:10.1002/sim.9352> and Zhou et al (2020)
